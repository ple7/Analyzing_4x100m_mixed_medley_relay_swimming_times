    "As we enter 2024, with [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) hosting the next summer [Olympic and Paralympic games](https://www.paris2024.org/en/), I am reminded of a novel and fun spectacle that I saw in the [Tokyo 2020 Olympics](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/tokyo-2020). The Tokyo games featured the 4x100m Mixed Medley Relay event in swimming for the first time, and I had the serendipitous pleasure of watching the final of this race live."

    "As its name suggests, each team in the 4x100m Mixed Medley Relay is made up of a combination of two male and two female swimmers, and similar to swimming's other medley races, the strokes to be swum are in this order: **backstroke**, **breaststroke**, **butterfly**, and **freestyle**. Of greatest interest, however, is that each team is free to choose whether a male or a female will swim a particular stroke, meaning that men can be pitted against women for a specific stroke[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fn1)."
