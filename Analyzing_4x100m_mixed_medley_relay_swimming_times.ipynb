    "As we enter 2024, with [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) hosting the next summer [Olympic and Paralympic games](https://www.paris2024.org/en/), I am reminded of a novel and fun spectacle that I saw in the [Tokyo 2020 Olympics](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/tokyo-2020). The Tokyo games featured the 4x100m Mixed Medley Relay event in swimming for the first time, and I had the serendipitous pleasure of watching the final of this race live."

    "As its name suggests, each team in the 4x100m Mixed Medley Relay is made up of a combination of two male and two female swimmers, and similar to swimming's other medley races, the strokes to be swum are in this order: **backstroke**, **breaststroke**, **butterfly**, and **freestyle**. Of greatest interest, however, is that each team is free to choose whether a male or a female will swim a particular stroke, meaning that men can be pitted against women for a specific stroke[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fn1)."

    "There were different strategies used by the teams in the final of [this race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye2wK3ClvO4) at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which saw an equal number of males and females swimming against each other in the backstroke and butterfly legs, while the breastroke leg contained one female up against seven males, and one male racing seven females in the freestyle stroke. The coaches would have presumably spent a lot of effort in trying to work out the best combination of swimmers for their respective teams [<sup>[2]</sup>](#fn2). Nevertheless, as I was watching this race, I wondered whether there would be a particular combination of swimmers that would yield an optimal time. In this project, I will analyse the times for all possible combinations to see which might be best."
